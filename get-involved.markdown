## Compete

To compete you must be a registered student of any highschool, college, or university. HPCC1 will be part of the [KnightHacks hackathon](https://2023.knighthacks.org/). HPCC1 is comprised of two categories: **Horse Plinko Yearling**, designed for players who have experienced at most two blue team competitions, and **Horse Plinko Stallion**, for players seeking a sterner test of skill.

Registration will open in late summer. In the meantime, you can join our mailing list [here](https://www.hackucf.org/plinko-interest).

## Become An Organizer

Any UCF student (or incoming UCF student) willing to learn can help organize Horse Plinko. We are seeking students interested in IaC tools like Terraform and Ansible, offensive security, OpenStack, network engineering, and more - no matter what you're interested in, we can probably use your help. To get involved, join the [Hack@UCF Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VwkkDcJ) and give yourself the Projects role under **#roles**.

Note that being an organizer does not prevent you from competing in HPCC, but will make you ineligible for placement/prizes that year.

## Sponsor Us
Sponsors are what keep us running! Every donation is greatly appreciated and recognized as a contribution to our continued success. HPCC has different tiers of sponsorship packages, including a logo on the competition shirts, tabling and speaking opportunities, and even a peg on our real-life plinko board that competition winners get to sign. Properly designated donations made through the Collegiate Cyber Defense Club Incorporated, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, may be tax deductible.
