All Horse Plinko events are themed and part of an overarching story. 

##  International Horse Plinko League (IHPL)

An international organization that organizes Horse Plinko events across the world. It originated in 1887, when the horse god Equus appeared before Caleb Sjostedt and Harrison Keating on a pilgrimage to Helsinki. They were granted immortality and a vision of a new sport to celebrate equine-kind, and formed the IHPL to spread it to the nations.

## Horse Liberation Front (HLF)

The HLF is an all-equine hacktivist group dedicated to opposing the IHPL. They see the game as antiquated and a disgrace to the horses who participate. 

## HPCC0 (April 2023)
In April 2023, the IHPL sought to expand to its first location in America. Florida was chosen since it has horses (and frankly, no other state would let them in). A locally sourced team of student cyber enthusiasts were tasked with defending the the systems of the new headquarters against the HLF on the day of the first Horse Plinko event in Florida. Although the HLF gained access to a few systems and caused some mischief, overall the event was a success. They have been beaten back for now, but rumour has it the HLF is gathering strength for a new attack this Fall.

## HPCC1 (October 2023)
To be revealed.
