<h3>The Horse Plinko Cyber Challenge (HPCC) is a cyber defense competition hosted as a joint effort between the University of Central Florida’s Collegiate Cybersecurity Competitions (C3) Team and Hack@UCF. It is 100% student-run and student-developed. In the hackathon spirit, the first HPCC was developed (from conception to competition day) in a little over a month. While the scope has increased since then, the core remains the same.</h3>

    <h3>Horse Plinko is a beginner-friendly event. We work on a “low skill floor, high skill ceiling” basis. New players should feel challenged but not overwhelmed, and experienced players should have a chance to show off their skills.</h3>
